# python-api-challenge
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. I am taking what I've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
In WeatherPy, I've learn to understand openweather-API documentation.  I used  info from the API doc to assemble target url, requested, and get response data back in JSON format.  I used matplotlip to help me creating data visualization and also regression plot for easily predicting a response and finding their correlation coeffienct .
In VacationPy, it was a continuous flow of knowlege.  I use response data from openweather api together with google place api to come up with a list of interested hotels.
